this is a very simple expenses tracker app made by me as training as i am about to learn react
its idea is to add some purshases to a list and it can be filtered by category and you can delete products as well

after donloading and extracting the code and opening it on your code editor you can run it using "npm run dev" on the terminal

thank you :-)
